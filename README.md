# In-Flight Value Pass

## Challenge Statement(s) Addressed 🎯
The project aims to offer airline passengers a distinct and compelling in-flight Wi-Fi experience. While T-Mobile provides benefits to its customers, we are committed to ensuring that our feature is not exclusive to any specific carrier, making it accessible to a wider range of passengers. Our primary focus is on affordability and value, offering reduced Wi-Fi costs to make the flight experience more budget-friendly and enjoyable. Which involves survey-driven discounts and brief video advertisements, providing passengers a strong incentive to participate and gain valuable benefits during their flights.

## Project Description 🤯
The project is designed to provide a unique in-flight Wi-Fi experience for airline passengers. It offers travelers the opportunity to access reduced Wi-Fi rates by participating in a brief survey during their flight. The process begins with passengers agreeing to terms and conditions, followed by a 30-second ad, after which they proceed to an 8-question multiple-choice survey, with an open-ended feedback option. Upon completing the survey, passengers are directed to a payment gateway, where they can avail of a $4 discount on the full duration flight Wi-Fi, reducing the price from $14 to $10. This feature is available exclusively on flights lasting 2.5 hours or more and also allows customers to save time by using their AA Advantage number, which is linked to their stored payment information.

## Project Value 💰
The project targets a diverse audience, from college students, to the budget-conscious traveler, and passengers who do not have annual or monthly Wi-Fi plans. The tangible benefits of this solution are multifaceted. Firstly, it offers cost savings by reducing the price of in-flight Wi-Fi from $14 to $10, which appeals to budget-conscious passengers and college students. Secondly, it enhances the user experience by providing an ad-supported survey that allows travelers to contribute their opinions while enjoying a discount for full-flight WiFi. Lastly, it benefits American Airlines by generating revenue through both survey data sales and increased Wi-Fi purchases, as well as by incentivizing customers to sign up for an AA account, which can foster long-term customer engagement and loyalty.
